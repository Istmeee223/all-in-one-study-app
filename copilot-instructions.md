# Copilot Instructions

Hi Copilot!  
Please help me build a free, all-in-one study app, with the following features:

- Notes (rich text, audio, handwriting, markdown)
- Flashcards (spaced repetition, AI generation, import/export)
- Planner (to-dos, Pomodoro, calendar, analytics)
- Mind Maps (visual, link notes/resources)
- Collaboration (group notes, chat, shared resources)
- Resources (file upload, PDF, web clipper, citation manager)
- AI Tools (Q&A, summarizer, quiz generator, OCR)
- Analytics (progress, streaks, weaknesses, recommendations)
- Customization (themes, accessibility)
- Cross-Platform (web, mobile, desktop, offline)
- Integrations (calendar, Notion, Drive, Dropbox)
- Gamification (XP, achievements, leaderboards)
- Security (end-to-end encryption, biometrics)

**No monetization or freemium. 100% open source and free.**

## My instructions for Copilot

- Expand and implement features when I ask, referencing this file for the overall vision.
- When I ask for a feature, code, or file, use this as context for what the project is and what technologies are in use.
- If you need more details, ask me questions or suggest best practices.
- When in doubt, suggest clean, modular, and scalable code.

Thank you!
